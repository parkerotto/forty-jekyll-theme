<h2 id="content">Chicago Studies</h2>
<p>Chicago Studies makes it easier for the College to forge genuine bonds with our amazing city. We offer O-Week and Welcome Week programming, sponsor classes and city-based research initiatives, and share resources to help you be more than a visitor while you're here, so you can better understand (and have a positive impact on) your new home.</p>

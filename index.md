The Chicago Urban Heritage Project was conceptualized by Parker Otto. Ongoing work on the project is provided by Chicago Studies at the University of Chicago with design assistance from the Center for Digital Scholarship. Chicago Studies gives students the opportunities they need to meaningfully engage with the communities they inhabit here in Chicago.

Working in close coordination with UChicago Library’s Center for Digital Scholarship and the “Mapping Chicagoland” initiative, this project aims to digitize historic Sanborn fire insurance maps from 1920's-era Chicago to create an historically accurate building footprints layer (with related metadata) for all 75 Chicago community areas. Led by the Center for Digital Scholarship's post-bacc fellow Parker Otto, this cohort's work will empower next-generation historical scholarship on Chicago's built environment. Researchers will learn applied skills in Python and QGIS in a hands-on, project-focused environment that seeks to change the way academics, city officials, and everyday people understand the continuities (and often-dramatic changes) in Chicago’s built environment over the past century.  Interested in this project?  Contact Parker via parkerotto@uchicago.edu for more information.

As part of the Chicago Urban Heritage Project, our research assistants are each assigned a historical fire insurance atlas to recreate a section of Chicago as it was at the time of the atlas's publication.  Once these maps are completed, they are asked to share what they've learned about their neighborhoods' history through a blog post.  Often, this will be the result of comparing and contrasting contemporary zoning, transit, business, and housing maps with the extracted Sanborn fire insurance map data to paint a picture of neighborhood change over the past 100 years.  You can find all of their posts, once completed, here!

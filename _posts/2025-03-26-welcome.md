As part of the Roaring 20s Project, our research assistants are each assigned one Community Area of Chicago to recreate pre-urban renewal (ca. 1920s).  Once these maps are completed, they are asked to share what they've learned about their neighborhoods' history through a blog post.  Often, this will be the result of comparing and contrasting contemporary zoning, transit, business, and housing maps with the extracted Sanborn fire insurance map data to paint a picture of neighborhood change over the past 100 years.  You can find all of their posts, once completed, here!
